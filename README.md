# Network_Config_Generator
Generate Network config. based on a Jinja2 template

This Simple Python based config. generator uses a Jinja2 standard config template 
to automate the generation of config. while populating the config. with the required data variables

There are more complex ways of doing that but i like simple ways :) and it works for me very well
